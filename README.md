```
git clone https://github.com/anchetaWern/realtime-server-health-monitor.git
```


2. Create a new Laravel project:

```
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel liveservermonitor
```

3. Copy all the relevant files from the cloned repo over to your newly generate project. Note that only the files that were changed or added for the app is added in the repo. So don't replace entire folders in your project with the one's in the repo. Only copy over the relevant files.

PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=YOUR_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER
```
